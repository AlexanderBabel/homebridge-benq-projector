# homebridge-benq-projector v1.0.0
Homebridge plugin for BenQ projectors via serial RS232 as HomeKit TVs. Requires iOS >=12.2 and homebridge >=0.4.46.

## Description
This plugin connects to a BenQ projector via serial RS232. Developed and tested using a Raspberry Pi and a USB to serial RS232 cable. Most of the serial code (`Transport.js`) sourced from [homebridge-epson-rs232](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-epson-projector-rs232). [homebridge-marantz-rs232](https://github.com/rooi/homebridge-marantz-rs232) was also referenced.

## Installation instructions

1. Install [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)
2. Connect to projector via RS232
3. Install this plugin:
```
npm install -g homebridge-benq-projector
```
4. Update your config.json, following the example below

- Occasional minor performance or stability issues. May result in delayed response from projector. In severe cases, the serial connection can get so out of sync a restart of homebridge might be necessary.
